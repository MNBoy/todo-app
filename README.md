This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## ❗️Notes
#### Because the tasks were supposed to be displayed separately for each user and this web application is deployed in Vercel, the data is not stored in the database and is stored in the client browser storage (Simulation of sending request to API is implemented).
